  /**
   * Throws any throwable 'sneakily' - you don't need to catch it, nor declare that you throw it onwards.
   * The exception is still thrown - javac will just stop whining about it.
   * <p>
   * Shamlessly stolen from the wonderful Project Lombok.
   * <p>
   * Example usage:
   * <p>
   * <pre>public void run() {
   *     throw sneakyThrow(new IOException("You don't need to catch me!"));
   * }</pre>
   * <p>
   * NB: The exception is not wrapped, ignored, swallowed, or redefined. The JVM actually does not know or care
   * about the concept of a 'checked exception'. All this method does is hide the act of throwing a checked exception
   * from the java compiler.
   * <p>
   * Note that this method has a return type of {@code RuntimeException}; it is advised you always call this
   * method as argument to the {@code throw} statement to avoid compiler errors regarding no return
   * statement and similar problems. This method won't of course return an actual {@code RuntimeException} -
   * it never returns, it always throws the provided exception.
   * 
   * @param t The throwable to throw without requiring you to catch its type.
   * @return A dummy RuntimeException; this method never returns normally, it <em>always</em> throws an exception!
